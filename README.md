# ZPRE-Implementation  
**Bio-Inspired Wireless Optimization for 6G ISAC**

---

## 🌐 Abstract
ZPRE-Implementation provides working prototypes of adaptive, bio-inspired algorithms for wireless optimization in next-generation networks.  
The repository focuses on **interference cancellation**, **energy efficiency**, and **standards-aligned integration** with **6G Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)**.  

Through validated simulation frameworks, these implementations demonstrate:  
- **+35–40% energy preservation**  
- **+20–25 dB SINR gain**  
- **Adaptive, real-time learning**  
- **Configurable operational modes** for diverse deployment scenarios  

This repository complements the theoretical research in [ZPRE-10-General-Field-Energy-Engine](https://github.com/leenathomas01/ZPRE-10-General-Field-Energy-Engine) by providing **runnable, standards-ready code**.
